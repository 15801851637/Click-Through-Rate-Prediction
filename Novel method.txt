We proposed a novel method to classify the click through rate. Due to the key-value constraints of the data, we try to convert it to some real number for better classification. We assume that each attribution has some attraction to make them click the ad. We also assume that each attribution is independent of each other. Based on these two assumption, we quantization each attribution by the click rate in the training set. After the quantization, we use Gaussian Naive Bayes to fit the data and obtain a model. Then, during the test phase, we could not directly obtain the click rate for each value of the attribute. So, we use some procedure similar to EM algorithm. First, using the population of each value in an attribute as the estimate of the click rate, then we use the trained model to classify the data. After the classification, we update the click rate based on the result and do another iteration. We stop the iteration after some predefined steps.
